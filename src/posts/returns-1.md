The journey of life is not about getting from point A to point B. It's about learning, forgetting, and relearning. It's about going away and returning. It's about seasons and cycles, each crystalizing in succession. 

> We shall not cease from exploration, and the end of all our exploring will be to arrive where we started and know the place for the first time.

> â€“ T.S. Eliot
